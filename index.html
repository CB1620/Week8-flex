            <h1>Welcome to my page.</h1>
            <h2>Here I will be writing some things about myself.</h2>

        <p>
            I am Christian Barlow, a 20-year-old guy from Castlegar, BC. I was born in Seattle, WA, USA.
            I picked up a hockey stick when I was 2, and played up until a couple years ago. Over the years, I would train by myself and with my team
            doing dryland, on-ice, and gym exercises. The ability to stay in good mental and physical shape for so long is <em>very</em> hard, but it
            is required for such a vigorous sport. A few years ago, I started making music and DJing at parties, as sort of my substitute for hockey.
            I have played all over the West Kootenays, and even opened for sold out shows in various spots of Washington. These concerts are amazing, 
            because I am able to meet the headliners, who are often people I have looked up to since a kid. Musically, I enjoy anything from country
            to classic rock to <strong>face melting death metal</strong> depending on my mood.
